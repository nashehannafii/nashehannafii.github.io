I'm **Moch. Nasheh Annafii**, an informatics, researcher, and system developer with interests in **Digital Twin technology**, **computer vision**, and **machine learning**. My work explores how structured data pipelines, computational modeling, and intelligent analysis can improve the reliability and scalability of digital systems across various domains.

I have practical experience in designing and developing digital solutions across web and mobile environments, integrating cloud-based storage, automated document processing, and data-driven workflows. My applied projects include financial record systems, organizational information platforms, and mobile applications that support efficient digital operations.

With an academic background in Informatics at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels, my research spans geometric and physical modeling, machine-learning-driven analysis, computer-vision-based data extraction, data integration architectures, and the broader development of Digital Twin concepts that incorporate physical, virtual, data, connection, and service dimensions.

I continue expanding my work in data-driven modeling, intelligent systems, and digital technologies, contributing to both research and real-world implementation in computational informatics.
